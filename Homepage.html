                <p>SICHONG is a service design project for older parents who have lost their adult children to relieve their pain. This project is based on the psychological thesis of the expressive writing. The project mainly focuses on the group of elderly people who have the ability of independent thinking and self-care in China. Through expressive writing, SICHONG enables the older adults to ease feelings of emotional trauma.</p>

                <h2>Individual Project: TRAVO</h2>
                <p>In the summer of 2019, I came to Lombok to teach a group of elementary school students as a volunteer. Through daily communication and observation, I found that although Lombok is a very beautiful island, its educational resources are not perfect. I decided to make an APP to help them with their education. Travo is a platform for volunteers and educators in Lombok. Volunteers can help teachers through their skills and also can get the traditional cultural experience of Lombok within budget.</p>

                <h2>Group Project: Spa de Esperanza</h2>
                <p>In the winter quarter of 2022, I took COGS 187B at UCSD. The class asked us to redesign website and mobile page for a client in real life. Our group decided to redesign the webpage of a skin care studio named Spa de Esperanza. There are four people in our team: Mathieu Lohier, Matthew Sorrenson, Christopher Yoon and me. We worked together for the client survey, competitive analysis, etc. For the prototyping part, I mainly took responsibility for redesigning the “Service Part”. </p>
